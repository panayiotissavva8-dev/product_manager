Prodexa is a C++ product and inventory management system built to explore how real-world business logic translates into code.
The goal is simple: manage products, track stock, prevent shortages, and persist data properly.
The execution is less simple, on purpose. This project is about learning systems, not shortcuts.
Built for Hack Club, learning, and future expansion into a web-based platform.

Why This Project Exists:
Prodexa goes one step further and asks:
-How do you persist data properly?
-How do you structure logic so it can scale?
-How do you turn a console app into something web-ready later?

Features:
- Product management (code, brand, name)
- Stock quantity tracking
- Low-stock alert system
-Cost, price, and discount handling
-Persistent storage with SQLite
-Modular, readable C++ functions
-Console-based MVP interface

What I Learned:
-How to design stateful systems
-Using SQLite correctly in C++
-Debugging logic bugs that don’t crash, just lie
-Why separation of concerns actually matters
-Thinking in terms of MVPs instead of “final versions”
-Preparing C++ code for backend/web adaptation

Roadmap:

Short-term:
 Refactor to full OOP (classes)
 Better error handling
 Sales history with timestamps
 
Mid-term:
 REST API using Crow
 Web frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
 Authentication system
 
Long-term:
 Full business management system
 Role-based users
 Analytics dashboard

This is a learning-first project.
Suggestions, issues, and pull requests are welcome.
